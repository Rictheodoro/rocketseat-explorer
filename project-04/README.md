👨‍💻 **Task:** build a sample form from a given [Figma model](https://www.figma.com/file/sgcJKpGAeVqh7rf2pwsOd9/Explorer-Stage-03-Projeto-01)

> Worked with forms to capture data from the web.
> 
> Learned about validation and further customization of the form templates available in HTML, without compromising accessibility.

💡 Highlight: Fixed the validation error, preventing the browser to apply the styles of `:invalid` pseudo-class as soon as the page loads in required form elements. Added a `:valid` style to be displayed after correct data entry.

🌱 **Stacks:** HTML | CSS
