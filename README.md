This is a way to document my journey as a WebDev aspirer 🚀

Here you'll find coursework projects and exercises I'm gathering throughout my experience on the Explorer course at Rocketseat, as well as other little projects I do along the way.   

If you like this way of documenting your journey, feel free to use it your own way. 

I'd appreciate if you say thanks **by ⭐ starring this repo** or mentioning me 😊

Also, please share any thoughts or suggestions you have or get in touch if I can help you with anything!
